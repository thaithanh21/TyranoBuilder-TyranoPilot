Hello hero [emb exp=f.playerName] ![p]
Your journey begins with the UI ![p]

The UI contains 3 parts.[p]
The one on the left gives the access to Components | Assets | Scenes. But, for now we just focus to the Components.[p]
Most important components are: STORY | CHARACTERS | IMAGES | MESSAGES[p]
The part on the right is the configuration area for current selected component in the middle section.[p]
Now take a look.[p]

Now, the middle part shows the flows of the game.[p]
On top left corner is the current selected Scene1.ks[p]
We'll have multiple scene, but for now just let it be like that.[p]
Now we go to the next session. I need you to remember this.[p]

#Character name tip 1
Character name start with hashtag # at the first line of the text.[p]
A text can only have one #Character name[p]
And a text should always to be closed at the at the end with a hashtag #[p]

#Tip 2
ALWAYS SAVE YOUR PROGRESS![p]
Before doing a preview/preview from here/debug it is IMPORTANT to save, TyranoBuilder is not perfect, so there is something is not complied if it is not saved.[p]

#Tip 3
To expand a component > double click on it.[p]
To expand all components > click on the expand icon on the top right corner.[p]
Colapes is the same you got the idea :)[p]

OK! what ever it is, We just made a branching decision,[l][r]
Wanna go back and check the other option again? to make sure I'm not a linear lying b*tch.[l][r]

Great, I can't count how many times you go back yet.[p]
But you got to this dialogue, so it is time for you to take a look at the code...[p]
Or at least the drag and drop thinggy.[p]
At this point, you are well mastered the basics of Story and messages components, as wel as control the flow of the game.[p]
On the next tutorial, we shall lear about multi Scene as well as using Characters components.[p]
